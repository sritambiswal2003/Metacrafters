The description of the functions in the project is as follows:

1.setNumber(uint _number) public: This function allows anyone to set the value of the number state variable. It takes an unsigned integer _number as input and assigns it to the number state variable.

2.requireStatement(uint _number) public view returns (uint): This function takes an unsigned integer _number as input and checks if it is greater than zero using the require statement. If the condition is not met, the function will revert with an error message "Number must be greater than zero." Otherwise, it will return the input _number.

3.assertStatement() public view returns (uint): This function checks if the value of the number state variable is equal to zero using the assert statement. If the condition is not met (i.e., number is not equal to zero), it will raise an exception, terminating the execution. Otherwise, it will return the value of the number state variable.

4.revertStatement(uint _i) public pure: This function takes an unsigned integer _i as input and checks if it is greater than 10 using the require statement. If the condition is not met, the function will revert with an error message "Input must be greater than 10." The function is declared as pure, meaning it does not modify the contract's state.
